if( (1 + 1 === 2 && 1 === 1) {
	console.log('this code appears')
	} else {
		console.log('this does not appear')
	}
>>This code appears - Because both expressions are true, if one of the expressions donÂ´t fulfill the condition, it will be false.

OR is a comparison operation that will let FALSE boolean value if one of the expressions is TRUE:

f.e. 

1 + 1 === 2 || 5 < 4 >> TRUE
